# When did you last clean +inside+ your Mattress?
  
Last week, last month, last year, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, NEVER!!!

Most people would not believe what accumulates in their mattresses over a period of time.  "What you don't know, or see, can't hurt you" yeah right!!!

Conventional mattressess are notorious for becoming a breeding ground for dust mites, and a respository for dead skin - just the things people struggling with asthma or any other respiratory disorders don't need.

# *Fact 1:* Waterbeds don't have anywhere for dust mites to live.
# *Fact 2:* The vinyl bladder and liner can be wiped clean of dead skin, dust etc. with just a damp cloth
# *Fact 3:* The wool top can be unzipped, taken off, and washed or dry-cleaned periodically to keep it fresh and hygenic.
# *Fact 4:* People with breathing problems have found that a waterbed gives them a more restful night.
  
If you google *_asthma_* and *_waterbed_* you will be faced with testimonials like:
    
> Hello everyone. My daughter has allergy induced asthma.  Since she struggles more at night we decided to get her a waterbed (fewer dust mites, etc) and this child went from having a nebulizer treatment 1-2 times a night to having 2 treatments in the last 2 weeks.  We are not used to living like this.  Less coughing and less struggle for her.  It is amazing

> I also have asthma and allergies.  I recently bought a waterbed and ever since, my asthma has been more in control.  I no longer wake up in the middle of the night needing my proventil inhaler.  I no longer feel stuffy in the morning when I wake up.  I agree that my waterbed is a big help
